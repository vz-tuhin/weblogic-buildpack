## Remote Triggering of Thread Dumps, Stats and Heap from App Instances

Using a set of shell scripts and the CF CLI interface, it is possible to trigger the data collection (like thread dumps or system metrics) across all instances of the application running on Cloud Foundry.
There are two actors handling the orchestration of the remote trigger actions: one on the client side, and the other on the application container (agent) side as explained in the following figure.

The application container will be configured to spawn off shell scripts (running in background) that is able to monitor for access modification timestamp of designated files.
This script kickoff is handled by the WebLogic Buildpack release step (that starts the application or its container).

```

Dump Action           Script             Designated Target File

Heap             dumpHeapAgent.sh       /home/vcap/tmp/dumpHeap

Stats            dumpStatsAgent.sh      /home/vcap/tmp/dumpStats

Thread           dumpThreadAgent.sh     /home/vcap/tmp/dumpThread

```

# Triggers

Using `cf files` or `cf curl`, users can access server side files from client side. This will update the access time of the target file.
The [trigger script](../resources/wls/monitoring/client/triggerDumps.sh) can be used to access specific target files for each trigger action.

```
$ ./triggerDumps.sh wls12c stats

Triggered stats dump on App: wls12c for instance: 0 by accessing filepath tmp/dumpStats under /home/vcap on application container

Finished triggering stats dumps for App: 'wls12c', across 1 instances

$ ./triggerDumps.sh wls12c thread

Triggered thread dump on App: wls12c for instance: 0 by accessing filepath tmp/dumpThread under /home/vcap on application container

Finished triggering thread dumps for App: 'wls12c', across 1 instances

```

The trigger script goes against each individual running application instance rather than the very first running instance as `cf files` does by default.


# Application Container Process Tree

The process tree structure looks like following:
```
┬─bash───bash─┬─2*[bash───tee]
            │             └─startWebLogic.s───startWebLogic.s───java───35*[{java}]
            └─monitorAgents.s─┬─dumpHeapAgent.s───sleep
                              ├─dumpStatsAgent.───sleep
                              ├─dumpThreadAgent───sleep
                              └─sleep
```
The dumperAgent.sh script kicks of the monitorAgents.sh script to run in background and exits.
The monitorAgents.sh script kicks off the various agents (thread/heap/stats) and keeps checking to ensure the scripts continue to run.
Each of the scripts look for change in the access time of a designated target file after some pre-determined sleep interval.
On modification, they trigger specific actions (like sending signals or using specific tools to trigger data like jstack/jmap etc.).
They also re-touch the file so any subsequent read access will change the access time as well as note time of their action so they can know there was an external trigger action.
Some actions can generate outputs in specific files that get saved under /home/vcap/dumps folder with day as a sub-folder

# Generated files:
```
root@17ot17mh2rs:/home/vcap# ls -lrt /home/vcap/dumps/

drwx------ 2 vcap vcap 4096 Jun  3 20:18 06_03_14

-rw------- 1 vcap vcap 95737852 Jun  3 20:18 wls12c-0.103.06_03_14.20_18_09.hprof
```


The script can create the designated target file (using unix touch call) and keep doing stat operation to check the last access time in a forever loop. On detecting some recent access of the target file (check for the timestamp difference since last touch by the script ), it can then kick off the relevant actions (like dumping threads or gathering system stats/metrics) and re-touch the file and save the most recent update time.

The WebLogic Buildpack bundles the background scripts as part of the application bits so they can pick the trigger signals sent via cf files or access of a designated target file to kick off the data collection.
The sample scripts are packaged under the resources/wls/monitoring folder.


# Capture of data


Using `cf files` or `cf curl`, users can access/download the generated server side files from client side.
The [capture script](../resources/wls/monitoring/client/captureDumps.sh) can be used to download the generated files by specifying the path and name of the files.

```
./captureDumps.sh wls12c
Listing contents of file or directory for App: wls12c , for instance: 0
 (fetching from /home/vcap/dumps/ )

06_03_14/                                    -

Finished capture of directory/file contents for App: 'wls12c', with # of running instances: 1


./captureDumps.sh wls12c 06_03_14/threadDump.wls12c-0.103.06_03_14.20_15_39.txt

Finished capture of directory/file contents for App: 'wls12c', with # of running instances: 1

```

The capture script goes against each individual running application instance and it might report error for some files as the files are generated with instance id.

Its also possible to use wildcard character with the captureDump script so one can request for thread*, or heap* or stats* and get the most recent (last file matching the given pattern) to be retrieved from the different instances that match the given pattern and path.

#Note:
Heap Dumps generated for Java Applications can be downloaded remotely using the capture script similar to the thread dumps.
cf curl cli version prior to 6.1.2 adds a newline character as part of the final output, the heap dump can appear corrupted when reading it with Java Heap Analyzers like Eclipse MAT tool. So, the script automatically stripts off the last byte from the saved output which can take sometime to complete.
Version 6.1.2 and newer allows --output option to save the output as a file and does not require this stripping of the last unneeded byte.

# Default Actions

The scripts bundled with the buildpack are generic enough that it can also be used by Ruby Applications as well as non-WebLogic Server targetted Java Applications.

* Java Applications would use jstack for thread dump generation. 5 Thread dumps would be collected at 5 second interval on each trigger action.
  It would use jmap to generate heap dumps.
* Ruby Applications would require x-ray gem to capture thread dumps. There is no jmap equivalent to generate heap dumps.
* The Stats script collections top, vmstat, mpstat, iostat, ps and environment log information as part of the dumpStats action.
